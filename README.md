CS-230 software design document
Steven Anderson

For this software design document the project was for the client "The Gaming Room". They wished to launch a program that was available on multiple OS types including mobile. The program was a game called "Draw it or Lose it" a game that involves random images that the teams will have 30 secounds to guess. Since the program required teams the client also wanted a form of log in for the players and a team name saved. The name was saved so no other name could be the same and the players on the team could be sorted. 

In this document I thought I did well with my recommendations for the client for the most useful system to produce the game on and run the game on. It was a recommendation to use windows for most of this with additional recommendations for 3rd party security and networking software. 
And on the same note I also feel I could have done better on the recommendations by putting together a comprehensive pricing document showing the price differences between the differing options. I could have priced it for a small to medium sized development company and been able to put a price to the suggestions I made.

The most useful part of the design document when it came to development was the UML diagram which helped form a visual tree as to what the program needed to be doing. I helped to show that player was relient on team which needed game which needed gameservice to run. Also give a good visual on what variables each of the coding files would be using and declaring. 

When making these documents keeping the user's needs in mind is very important. In my document I made sure to keep the mindset that the client might not have coders fluent in Mac or linux coding practices and that since they are a small to medium sized company they would want the most bang for what they are paying for. My recommendation to use windows was inspired by this since they would already be familiar with windows and they can save money using some of windows built in features when developing their project. It also enables them to make use of plenty of 3rd party tools without worrying if they will work on their system.

As far as what I will being doing in the future when making desing documents I will definately be keeping a log of access dates so I can get an idea of why I updated it the way I did. I will also be focusing on the needs and resources of the client so I don't end up developing something they don't need or something that goes way over budget to what they were expecting. I will also in the future probably be making more UML diagrams as I proceed through a project so I can track and organize any redesigns that I made along the way.
